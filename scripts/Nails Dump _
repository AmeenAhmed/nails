Routes : 
	1. Match => Matches the route with the given controller#action eg: [ "photos" : { match : "home#photos"} ]

	2. Get => Matches the route with given controller#action via only GET eg: [ "photos" : { get : "home#photos" } ]

	3. Post => Matches the route with given controller#action via only POST [ "photos" : { post : "home#photos" } ]

	4. via => Appears when a match param is given. specifies the methods to which the route will respond 
		eg: [ "photos" : { match : "home#photos", via:"get|post"} ]

	5. Match : resource => Matches a controller to a number of default resourceful routes(given below)

	

	Notes :
		a. A route cannot have both a match and get or post together because sinmply it doesn't make sense, If found the match only will have the highest priority
